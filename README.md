# A basic implementation of infinite scrolling using typescript and ReactJS
I have used react-infinite-scroll-component to create a basic project where user can see products of different categories and infinetely scroll through them.
This project is just a demo implementation for infinite scrolling, all the products that are shown are demo texts and images.
